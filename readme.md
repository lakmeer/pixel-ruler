## A handy dandy ruler for working on your website

Pops a simple ruler at the side of your page and shows a tooltip of how far
from the top of the screen your mouse is. Use it to measure stuff the inspector
doesn't tell you like offset and scrollTop.

### Demo

- clone
- gulp develop

### Use it

- include `dist/pixelRuler.js`
- `pixelRuler(20)` (for 20px wide ruler)

### Todo

- Maybe show other stats than just pageY?
- Snap to elements?
- Horizontal also?
- Drag to measure range?
- Click to set extents of range?

All swell ideas.
